# Roller Conveyor Design Project

This project focuses on designing an efficient roller conveyor system for industrial use. The system uses a WEG 7518EP3ESS56CFL motor delivering 2.45 N·m at 1909 RPM, with a safety margin up to 5 N·m. It includes technical calculations, motor selection analysis, and design images.

## Files
- /Calculations/CALCULATION OF CONVEYOR.pdf: Detailed torque and power analysis
- /Images/WEG_Motor_Design.png: Photos of the motor and system

## Tools Used
- SolidWorks (for CAD design)
- VFD for speed and torque control

## Notes
- The motor frame size is 56C, optimized for compact design.
- Calculations based on P = (T × ω) / 9550.
